/**
 * Validates the data that the user has specified while attempting to take an offer, so that the offer taking
 * transaction does not revert.
 *
 * This function ensures that:
 *  - the isUserMaker field is false (meaning the user is not the maker of the offer).
 *  - the havePublicKey field is true (meaning this interface has a copy of the maker's public key).
 *  - (if the offer's lower and upper bound amounts are not equal) the takenSwapAmount is within the bounds specified by
 *  the offer maker.
 *  - the user has selected a settlement method accepted by the maker.
 *  - the user has selected one of their own settlement methods that is compatible with the maker's settlement method
 *  that the user has selected
 *  - the user has supplied their information for the selected settlement method, and the information is valid.
 *
 *  @param offer The [Offer] that is being taken.
 *  @param takenSwapAmount (If the lower and upper bound amounts of [offer] are equal, this will not be used.) The
 *  stablecoin amount that the user wants to buy/sell as a [BigDecimal]
 *  @param selectedMakerSettlementMethod One of the settlement methods specified by the maker, by which the user wants
 *  to send/receive payment to/from the maker.
 *  @param selectedTakerSettlementMethod One of the user's settlement methods, that has the same method and currency
 *  properties as [selectedMakerSettlementMethod], and contains the user's private information that will be sent to the
 *  maker.
 *  @param stablecoinInformationRepository The [StablecoinInformationRepository] that this will use to convert
 *  [takenSwapAmount] to ERC20 base units.
 *
 *  @return A [ValidatedNewSwapData] derived from the inputs to this function.
 *
 *  @throws [NewSwapDataValidationException] if this is not able to ensure any of he conditions in the list above. The
 *  descriptions of the exceptions thrown by this function are human-readable and can be displayed to the user so that
 *  they can correct any problems.
