/**
 * A wrapper around an optional [RawTransaction] that was created by this interface and should be monitored by this
 * interface for confirmation, transaction dropping, transaction failure and transaction success. The [transaction]
 * property of an instance of this struct may be `null` if this [BlockchainTransaction] represents a transaction that
 * was created before a restart of the application. In this case, only the hash of such a transaction is saved in
 * persistent storage, and so this struct will have been re-created using that hash in persistent storage, not the
 * [RawTransaction] itself. This also contains the date and time at which the original transaction was created, as well
 * as the latest block number of the blockchain at the time when the original transaction was created.
 *
 * @property transaction The [RawTransaction] that this wraps.
 * @property transactionHash The hash of [transaction], or if [transaction] is `null`, the hash of the transaction that
 * this struct represents.
 * @property timeOfCreation The date and time at which this was created.
 * @property latestBlockNumberAtCreation The number of the latest block in the blockchain at the time when this
 * transaction was created.
 * @property type Describes what [transaction] does. (For example: one that opens a new offer, one that fills a swap,
 * etc).
