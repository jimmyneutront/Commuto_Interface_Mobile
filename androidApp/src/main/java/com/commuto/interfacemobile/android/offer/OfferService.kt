    /**
     * The method called by [BlockchainService] to notify [OfferService] of a [OfferEditedEvent].
     *
     * Once notified, [OfferService] saves [event] in [offerEditedEventRepository], gets updated on-chain offer data by
     * calling [BlockchainService.getOffer], and verifies that the chain ID of the event and the offer data match. Then
     * this checks if the user of the interface is the maker of the offer being edited. If so, then the new settlement
     * methods for the offer and their associated private data should be stored in the pending settlement methods
     * database table. So this gets that data from [databaseService], and then deserializes the data to
     * [SettlementMethod] objects and adds them to a list, logging warnings when such a [SettlementMethod] has no
     * associated private data. Then this creates another list of [SettlementMethod] objects that it creates by
     * deserializing the settlement method data in the new on-chain offer data. Then this iterates through the latter
     * list of [SettlementMethod] objects, searching for matching [SettlementMethod] objects in the former list
     * (matching meaning that price, currency, and fiat currency values are equal; obviously on-chain settlement methods
     * will have no private data). If, for a given [SettlementMethod] in the latter list, a matching [SettlementMethod]
     * (which definitely has associated private data) is found in the former list, the matching element in the former
     * list is added to a third list of [SettlementMethod]s. Then, this persistently stores the third list of new
     * [SettlementMethod]s as the offer's settlement methods. Then this checks whether the corresponding [Offer] has a
     * non-`null` [Offer.offerEditingTransaction] property. If it does, then this compares the transaction hash of the
     * value of that property to that of [event]. If they match, this sets a flag indicating that these transaction
     * hashes match. If this flag is set, this persistently updates [Offer]s [Offer.editingOfferState] property to
     * [EditingOfferState.COMPLETED]. Then, on the main coroutine dispatcher, if the matching transaction hash flag has
     * been set, this updates the corresponding [Offer]'s [Offer.editingOfferState] to [EditingOfferState.COMPLETED] and
     * clears the [Offer]'s [Offer.selectedSettlementMethods] list. Then, still on the main coroutine dispatcher,
     * regardless of the status of the flag, this sets the corresponding [Offer]'s settlement methods equal to the
     * contents of the third list of new [SettlementMethod]s.
     *
     * If the user of this interface is not the maker of the offer being edited, this creates a new list of
     * [SettlementMethod]s by deserializing the settlement method data in the new on-chain offer data, persistently
     * stores the list of new [SettlementMethod]`s as the offer's settlement methods, and sets the corresponding
     * [Offer]'s settlement methods equal to the contents of this list on the main coroutine dispatcher.
     *
     * @param event The [OfferEditedEvent] of which [OfferService] is being notified.
     *
     * @throws [OfferServiceException] if the chain ID of [event] doesn't match the chain ID of the offer obtained from
     * [BlockchainService.getOffer] when called with [OfferEditedEvent.offerID].
