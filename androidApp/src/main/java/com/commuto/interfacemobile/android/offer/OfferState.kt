/**
 * Describes the state of an [Offer] according to the
 * [Commuto Interface Specification](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-whitepaper/blob/main/commuto-interface-specification.txt).
 * The order in which the non-cancellation-related cases of this `enum` are defined is the order in which an offer
 * should move through the states that they represent. The order in which the cancellation-related cases are defined is
 * the order in which an offer being canceled should move through the states that they represent.
 *
 * @property OPENING Indicates that [openOffer](https://www.commuto.xyz/docs/technical-reference/core-tec-ref#open-offer)
 * has not yet been called for the corresponding offer.
 * @property OPEN_OFFER_TRANSACTION_BROADCAST Indicates that the transaction to open the corresponding offer has been
 * broadcast.
 * @property AWAITING_PUBLIC_KEY_ANNOUNCEMENT Indicates that the
 * [OfferOpened event](https://www.commuto.xyz/docs/technical-reference/core-tec-ref#offeropened) for the corresponding
 * offer has been detected, so, if the offer's maker is the user of the interface, the public key should now be
 * announced; otherwise this means that we are waiting for the maker to announce their public key.
 * @property OFFER_OPENED Indicates that the corresponding offer has been opened on chain and the maker's public key has
 * been announced.
 * @property TAKEN Indicates that the corresponding offer has been taken.
 * @property CANCELING Indicates that the corresponding offer will be canceled, but
 * [cancelOffer](https://www.commuto.xyz/docs/technical-reference/core-tec-ref#offercanceled) has not yet been called
 * for it.
 * @property CANCEL_OFFER_TRANSACTION_BROADCAST Indicates that the transaction to cancel the corresponding offer has
 * been broadcast.
 * @property CANCELED Indicates that the corresponding offer has been canceled on chain.
 * @property indexNumber An [Int] corresponding to this state's position in a list of possible offer states organized
 * according to the order in which an offer should move through them, with the earliest state at the beginning
 * (corresponding to the integer 0) and the latest state at the end (corresponding to the integer 3).
 * @property asString A [String] corresponding to a particular case of [OfferState].
