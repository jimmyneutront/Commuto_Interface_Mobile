        - amountUpperBound: The value of the corresponding Offer's `amountUpperBound` property.
        - securityDepositAmount: The amount of stablecoin that the maker and taker must lock up in escrow during this swap.
        - serviceFeeRate: The percentage times 100 of `takenSwapAmount` that the swap maker and taker must pay as a service fee.
        - direction: The direction of the swap, either `buy` or `sell`.
        - onChainSettlementMethod: The settlement method selected by the taker, as serialized by the maker of the corresponding offer.
        - protocolVersion: Indicates the minimum Commuto Interface version that one must have in order to take this offer.
        - isPaymentSent: Indicates whether the buyer has sent traditional currency payment for this Swap.
        - isPaymentReceived: Indicates whether the seller has received traditional currency payment for this Swap.
        - hasBuyerClosed: Indicates whether the buyer has claimed their purchased stablecoin and reclaimed their security deposit (and the unspent service fee, if any, if they are the maker).
        - hasSellerClosed: Indicates whether the seller has reclaimed their security deposit (and the unspent service fee, if any, if they are the maker)
        - onChainDisputeRaiser: Corresponds to an on-chain Swap's raw value.
        - chainID: The ID of the blockchain on which this swap exists.
