     On the global `DispatchQueue`, this creates and persistently stores a new key pair, creates a new offer ID and a new `Offer` from the information contained in `offerData`. Then, still on the global `DispatchQueue`, this persistently stores the new `Offer`,  approves token transfer to the [CommutoSwap](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-protocol/blob/main/CommutoSwap.sol) contract, calls the CommutoSwap contract's [openOffer](https://www.commuto.xyz/docs/technical-reference/core-tec-ref#open-offer) function, passing the new offer ID and `Offer`, and updates the state of the offer to `openOfferTransactionBroadcast`. Then, on the main `DispatchQueue`, the new `Offer` is added to `offerTruthSource`.
     
     - Parameters:
        - offerData: A `ValidatedNewOfferData` containing the data for the new offer to be opened.
        - afterObjectCreation: A closure that will be executed after the new key pair, offer ID and `Offer` object are created.
        - afterPersistentStorage: A closure that will be executed after the `Offer` is persistently stored.
        - afterTransferApproval: A closure that will be run after the token transfer approval to the [CommutoSwap](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-protocol/blob/main/CommutoSwap.sol) contract is completed.
        - afterOpen: A closure that will be run after the offer is opened, via a call to [openOffer](https://www.commuto.xyz/docs/technical-reference/core-tec-ref#open-offer).
     
     - Returns: An empty promise that will be fulfilled when the new Offer is opened.
     
     - Throws: An `OfferServiceError.unexpectedNilError` if `offerTruthSource` is `nil` or if `blockchainService` is `nil`. Note that because this function returns a `Promise`, these errors will not actually be thrown, but will be passed to `seal.reject`.

    /**
     The function called by `BlockchainService` to notify `OfferService` of an `OfferOpenedEvent`.
     
     Once notified, `OfferService` saves `event` in `offerOpenedEventsRepository`, gets all on-chain offer data by calling `blockchainServices's` `getOffer` method, verifies that the chain ID of the event and the offer data match, and then checks if the offer has been persistently stored in `databaseService`. If it has been persistently stored and if its `isUserMaker` field is true, then the user of this interface has created this offer, and so `OfferService`updates the offer's status to `awaitingPublicKeyAnnouncement`, announces its corresponding public key by getting its key pair from `keyManagerService` and passing the public key of the key pair and the offer ID specified in `event` to `P2PService.announcePublicKey`, and then updates the offer state to `offerOpened`. If the offer has not been persistently stored or if its `isUserMaker` field is false, then `OfferService` creates a new `Offer` with the results, checks if `keyManagerService` has the maker's public key and updates the `Offer`'s `havePublicKey` property accordingly, persistently stores the new offer and its settlement methods, removes `event` from `offerOpenedEventsRepository`, and then synchronously maps the offer's ID to the new `Offer` in `offerTruthSource`'s `offers` dictionary on the main thread.
