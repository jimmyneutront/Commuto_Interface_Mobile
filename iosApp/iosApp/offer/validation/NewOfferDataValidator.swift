 This function ensures that:
 - the user has selected a valid stablecoin
 - the minimum stablecoin amount is greater than zero
 - the maximum stablecoin amount is greater than or equal to the minimum amount

 - the minimum service fee amount is greater than zero
 - the user has specified a valid direction
 - the user has selected at least one settlement method
 - the user has specified a price for each selected settlement method.
 - the user has supplied their information for each selected settlement method.
 
- Parameters:
    - chainID: The ID of the blockchain on which the offer should be created.
    - stablecoin: The contract address of the stablecoin selected by the user, or `nil` if the user has not selected a stablecoin.
    - stablecoinInformation: The `StablecoinInformation` for the stablecoin selected by the user, or `nil` if the user has not selected a stablecoin.
    - minimumAmount: The minimum stablecoin amount to be exchanged, as specified by the user.
    - maximumAmount: The maximum stablecoin amount to be exchanged, as specified by the user.
    - securityDepositAmount: The security deposit amount, as specified by the user.
    - serviceFeeRate: The current [service fee rate](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-whitepaper/blob/main/commuto-whitepaper.txt).
    - direction: The exchange direction indicated by the user, either `buy` or `sell`.
    - settlementMethods: The `SettlementMethod`s selected by the user.
 
 - Returns: A `ValidatedNewOfferData` derived from the inputs to this function.
 
 - Throws: A `NewOfferDataValidationError` if this is not able to ensure any of the conditions in the list above. The descriptions of the errors thrown by this function are human-readable and can be displayed to the user so that they can correct any problems.

/**
 Converts a stablecoin amount as a `Decimal` to a base unit amount as a `BigUInt`, according to the decimal value of `stablecoinInformation`. So for example, consider USDC with a decimal value of 6: `Decimal(1)` USDC becomes `BigUInt("1_000_000")` USDC in base units.

 It would be nice to multiply the amount `Decimal` by ten raised to the power of the stablecoin's decimal value, convert the result to an `Int`, and then convert that Int to a `BigUInt`. However, stablecoin's decimal values can be large, which would result in an overflow error when converting the `Decimal` to an `Int`. The following is an example of what NOT to do:
 
 ```
 let amountBaseUnits = BigUInt(NSDecimalNumber(decimal: amount * pow(Decimal(10), stablecoinInformation.decimal)).rounding(accordingToBehavior: roundingHandler).intValue)
 ```
 
 Instead, we ensure the amount has no more than six decimal places, and then convert its significand to an `Int` by rounding up and then a `BigUInt`. This should be safe, since the significand should have zero decimal places itself. Then, recalling that `minimumAmount.exponent` will be negative whenever `amount` has numbers on the trialing side of the decimal point, we calculate `intermediateUnitsAmountExponent = stablecoinInformation.decimal + minimumAmount.exponent`.  If `intermediateUnitsAmountExponent` is positive, we multiply the `BigUInt` amount by `BigUInt(10).pow(intermediateUnitsAmountExponent)` If `intermediateUnitsAmountExponent` is negative, we divide the `BigUInt` amount by `BigUInt(10).pow(-intermediateUnitsAmountExponent)`. Note that the result will be truncated to an integer, not rounded.  This gives us our resulting amount in stablecoin base units, and allows us to handle the case in which the stablecoin's decimal value is less than the number of decimal places in `amount`.
 
 
 Examples:
 
 Consider the amount 1.234 for a stablecoin with a decimal value of 2:
 - amount exponent = -3
 - amount in intermediate units = 1234
 - intermediate units exponent = 2 + -3 = -1
 The intermediate units exponent is negative, so we return: `1234 / 10.pow(-(-1)) = 123` (recalling that the division is truncated.)
 
 Consider the amount 1.234 for a stablecoin with a decimal value of 6:
 -  amount exponent = -3
 - amount in intermediate units = 1234
 - intermediate units exponent = 6 + -3 = 3
 The intermediate units exponent is positive, so we return `1234 * 10.pow(3) = 1_234_000`.
 
 - Parameters:
    - amount: The `Decimal` amount to be converted to base units.
    - stablecoinInformation: The `StablecoinInformation` from which this gets the decimal value to use when converting `amount`.
 
 - Returns `amount` in token base units as a `BigUInt`.
 
 - Throws: An `OfferServiceError.newOfferDataValidationError` if `amount` is not positive, or if `amount`'s exponent value is greater than six.
