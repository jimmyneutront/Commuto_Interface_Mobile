/**
 Validates the data that the user has specified while attempting to take an offer, so that the offer taking transaction does not revert.
 
 This function ensures that:
    - the isUserMaker field is false (meaning the user is not the maker of the offer)
    - the havePublicKey field is true (meaning this interface has a copy of the maker's public key)
    - (if the offer's lower and upper bound amounts are not equal) the takenSwapAmount is within the bounds specified by the offer maker
    - the user has selected a settlement method
    - the settlement method selected by the user is accepted by the offer maker
 
 - Parameters:
    - offer: The `Offer` that is being taken.
    - takenSwapAmount: (If the lower and upper bound amounts of `offer` are equal, this will not be used.) The stablecoin amount that the user wants to buy/sell as a `Decimal`
    - selectedSettlementMethod: The settlement method by which the user wants to send/receive payment to/from the maker.
    - stablecoinInformationRepository: The `StablecoinInformationRepository` that this will use to convert `takenSwapAmount` to ERC20 base units.
 
 - Returns: A `ValidatedNewSwapData` derived from the inputs to this function.
 
 - Throws: A `NewSwapDataValidationError` if this is not able to ensure any of the conditions in the list above. The descriptions of the errors thrown by this function are human-readable and can be displayed to the user so that they can correct any problems.
