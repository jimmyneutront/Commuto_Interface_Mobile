 Describes the state of an `Offer` according to the [Commuto Interface Specification](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-whitepaper/blob/main/commuto-interface-specification.txt). The order in which the non-cancellation-related cases of this `enum` are defined is the order in which an offer should move through the states that they represent. The order in which the cancellation-related cases are defined is the order in which an offer being canceled should move through the states that they represent.
