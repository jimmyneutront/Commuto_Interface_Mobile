/**
 A wrapper around an optional `EthereumTransaction` that was created by this interface and should be monitored by this interface for confirmation, transaction dropping, transaction failure and transaction success. The `transaction` property of an instance of this struct may be `nil` if this `BlockchainTransaction` represents a transaction that was created before a restart of the application. In this case, only the hash of such a transaction is saved in persistent storage, and so this struct will have been re-created using that hash in persistent storage, not the `EthereumTransaction` itself. This also contains the date and time at which the original transaction was created, as well as the latest block number of the blockchain at the time when the original transaction was created.
